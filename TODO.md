# TODO

-   Consistent capitalization of 'Cross-validated MANOVA'
    as well as 'Cross-validated Cross-MANOVA'
    consistent numerus for 'data'

-   give ids to errors (asserts) and warnings

-   use strings vs character arrays consistently

-   Rename class `CvCrossManova` / clarify class `Analysis`
    use namespace / package?

-   MATLAB Testing Framework
    https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-unit-test-framework.html

-   Two tutorials:
    -   High-level using SPM and searchlight and region functions,
        applied to Haxby data
    -   Low-level using class directly, using what data? EEG would be nice.
        see "/home/ca/Store/netgrab/ERP CORE P3 1.zip"

-   use dedicated tests instead of `asserts` within the tutorial

-   Do we need an option to omit high-pass filtering & whitening?
