# TODO

-   Consistent capitalization of 'Cross-validated MANOVA'
    as well as 'Cross-validated Cross-MANOVA'
    consistent numerus for 'data'

-   give ids to errors (asserts) and warnings

-   use strings vs character arrays consistently

-   Rename class `CvCrossManova` / clarify class `Analysis`
    use namespace / package?

-   use dedicated tests instead of `asserts` within the tutorial
    see MATLAB Testing Framework
    https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-unit-test-framework.html

-   Two tutorials:
    -   High-level using SPM and searchlight and region functions,
        applied to Haxby data
    -   Low-level using class directly, using ERP CORE.
        
-   Do we need an option to omit high-pass filtering & whitening?

-   pre-render script transforms `qmd` to `m` with
    `jupytext file.qmd --to m`
    can we attach these to the pages?

-   integrate documentation of cvmanova,
    especially explanation negative D-values

-   integrate new repository with old one?
    making cvcrossmanova an evolution of cvmanova
