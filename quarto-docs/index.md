It has been developed with [Matlab](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) R2023a (v9.14) and [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) r7771, but should work with later and slightly earlier versions.

The software does not depend on other toolboxes, except `cvCrossManovaRegion` and `cvCrossManovaSearchlight` which depend on SPM12 being installed.
