This project is under development and not yet usable.

This software is copyrighted Â© 2023 by [Carsten Allefeld](https://allefeld.github.io/) and released under the terms of the [GNU General Public License, version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or later.

It has been developed with Matlab R2023a (v9.14) and SPM12 r7771, but should work with later and slightly earlier versions.

The software does not depend on other toolboxes, except `cvCrossManovaRegion` and `cvCrossManovaSearchlight` which depend on SPM12 being installed.
